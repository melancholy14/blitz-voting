## Database

### PostgreSQL

I've got inspired by [this page](https://blitzjs.com/docs/database-overview) and chose `PostgreSQL` as a RDBMS for the following reasons;

1. Easy to install: [Railway](https://railway.app/) would be the deployment platform for this web application and it let me use `PostgreSQL` for free.
2. Will use in future: The company where I'm working for is planning to use `PostgreSQL` for the next product. So, it will be beneficial to learn it before the plan is started.

[This article](https://www.prisma.io/dataguide/postgresql/benefits-of-postgresql) is a great one if you want to know about PostgreSQL.

#### How to install PostgreSQL

As Mac is my laptop, I decided to use `homebrew` to install it: https://www.sqlshack.com/setting-up-a-postgresql-database-on-mac/

### Fauna

[Fauna](https://fauna.com/) is the serverless database API service and would work well together with Vercel: https://blitzjs.com/docs/fauna
Besides, Fauna and Vercel offer free-tier which is enough for study-purposed development. Would consider using these services once MVPs are implemented.

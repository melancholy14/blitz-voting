### Tech Stack

1. Web framework

   - This project is based on _[Blitz.js](https://blitzjs.com/)_ since it's started to follow [the tutorial of Blitz.js](https://blitzjs.com/docs/tutorial) at the beginning. After all, I ended up deciding to take advantage of this project to study my architectural practice.

2. CSS Framework

   There have been a lot of CSS frameworks over the frontend's world. However, I'd like to try [Blitz recipes](https://blitzjs.com/docs/using-recipes) and Blitz let me choose one of the below options;

   - [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/): I've already been using Tailwindcss at my workplace. So, I wanted to skip this for my study.
   - [chakra-ui](https://chakra-ui.com/): Chakra-UI is consist of more modular and simpler React UI components. The goal of this library is to let developers build React applications with modular and accessible UI components.
   - [material-ui](https://material-ui.com/): Material-UI is based on Material Design. It aims to let developers build UI components faster. In my opinion, Material-UI would be a kinda frontend framework specialised in Styling. It has most UI components such as `<Table />` or `<Button />`.

   I chose `chakra-ui` because I've been attracted by the modularity of styling, which made me feel free to implement my own UI components. I've referenced these articles; [this](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/comparison) and [this](https://stackshare.io/stackups/chakra-ui-vs-material-ui)
